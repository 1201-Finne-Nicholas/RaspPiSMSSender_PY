# RaspPiSMSSender_PY
Using a raspberry pi 3, SIM card, USB 3G modem, and some python code to be able to send SMS messages.

A project I am doing for my dad to help him send out a message to all his customers at once.

I will paste hardware links and how to set it up to run this code. 
But, I have not yet tried this program with the hardware so I will update the README once I have done so.
